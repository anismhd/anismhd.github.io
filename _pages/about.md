# Hello, I'm Anis M. Vengasseri 👋

## [Draft for About Me Page]
Under Construction
Please note that this website is currently in development. Some links may be inactive, and content is being updated regularly to reflect my latest projects and research. Thank you for your patience!

Welcome to my personal website! 

## About Me

I am Anis M. Vengasseri, a Structural Engineer specializing in the safety and analysis of nuclear structures. With over a decade of experience—ranging from the rigorous regulatory environment of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (India) to my current role at NRG PALLAS (Netherlands).


## What I Do
My expertise lies in ensuring that high-stakes facilities, particularly Nuclear Power Plants, can withstand the most extreme environmental demands. I specialize in:

Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA): Developing frameworks to quantify ground motion risks using custom-built tools in MATLAB and Python.

Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI): Modeling how complex structures behave in tandem with the ground they sit on using specialized software like ACS SASSI.

Advanced Finite Element Analysis (FEA): Utilizing ABAQUS and ANSYS to solve non-linear structural challenges.

Regulatory Guidance: Translating complex engineering data into industry standards and safety guidelines.

## Academic Roots

My approach to engineering is grounded in a deep academic foundation:

M.Tech in Structural Engineering | IIT Madras: Graduated as a Gold Medalist, focusing on uncertainty quantification and stochastic modeling.

B.Tech in Civil Engineering | NIT Calicut: Where my fascination with the built environment began.

## Beyond the Code

While I spend much of my time in the world of Fortran, Python, and GIS, I am a firm believer in the "human element" of engineering. Safety isn't just about meeting a code; it’s about protecting communities and the environment through precision and foresight.

Currently based in Alkmaar, Netherlands, I am always looking to connect with fellow engineers, researchers, and tech enthusiasts.
